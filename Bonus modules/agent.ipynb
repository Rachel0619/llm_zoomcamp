      "answer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\n",
      "Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\n",
      "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",
      "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",

      "The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.\n",
      "Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.\n",

      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?\n",
      "answer: No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\n",
      "\n",
      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Course - Can I follow the course after it finishes?\n",

      "For everything in the course, there’s a local alternative. You could even do the whole course locally.\n",

      "Later modules (module-05 & RisingWave workshop) use shell scripts in *.sh files and most Windows users not using WSL would hit a wall and cannot continue, even in git bash or MINGW64. This is why WSL environment setup is recommended from the start.\n",

Familiarize Yourself with Docker and Terraform: Understand the basics of these tools by reading documentation and watching introductory videos. 2. Engage with Course Materials: Pay attention to lectures, notes, and assignments, and take notes to reinforce learning. 3. Hands-On Practice: Set up Docker and Terraform environments on your own for better confidence and understanding. 4. Utilize Resources: Leverage additional resources provided, including recommended readings and tutorials. 5. Join Study Groups: Collaborate with fellow students to enhance understanding and share resources. 6. Participate in Office Hours: Use live sessions to ask questions and clarify doubts. 7. Consistent Review: Regularly review what you've learned to solidify understanding.\",\n",
